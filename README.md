# cosmiccafe
## a task from school: In the distant galaxy of Zogarion, a group of friendly aliens have opened an intergalactic cafe called the "Cosmic Café". They have asked you for help in creating a website to attract visitors from all over the universe. They are particularly interested in using exciting fonts and colors to make their website an intergalactic experience!
### Description:
Create a basic web page for Cosmic Café with the following elements:
 A header with the text "Welcome to Cosmic Café!".
 A description text that says: "A unique cafe in space where you can enjoy cosmic flavors."
 A section titled "Our Galactic Dishes" and an unsorted list containing some intergalactic dishes (eg "Star Streamers" or "Black Hole Coffee").

Use the following style rules to create the intergalactic atmosphere:
 Use an exciting and futuristic font for the entire page.
 Use a dark space black background color for the entire page.
 Style headlines and body text to make them more intergalactic.

Test your web page in the browser to see how it looks. Adjust styles as needed to achieve the desired intergalactic atmosphere.
